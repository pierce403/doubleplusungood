# Security Timeline Notes

This repository exists to drive a security-focused timeline narrative for the vendored `notepad-plus-plus/` codebase. Upstream sources live in `notepad-plus-plus/` but are ignored here; only our notes and helper docs are tracked.

## Layout
- `AGENTS.md`: instructions and mission context for coding agents.
- `notes/`: add Markdown drafts (e.g., `security-timeline.md`) with sourced entries.

## Working guidelines
- Keep references to specific files/commits/docs when adding timeline entries.
- Avoid modifying upstream code unless explicitly tasked; treat `notepad-plus-plus/` as read-only.
- Keep changes small and documented; follow `AGENTS.md` for style and process.
