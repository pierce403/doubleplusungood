# News coverage – Notepad++ updater malware incident (Dec 2025)

## Summary of reporting (chronological)
- 2025-12-09 — The Register coverage of Patch Tuesday notes that attackers hijacked WinGUp traffic to malicious servers; v8.8.9 released to fix weak validation of update files and was already being abused in the wild. citeturn0search6
- 2025-12-10 — Cybernews reports MITM hijacks of WinGUp, citing Kevin Beaumont and Don Ho; says traffic was occasionally redirected to malicious servers, prior self-signed certs made spoofing easier, and 8.8.9 hardens signature/certificate checks. citeturn0search0
- 2025-12-10 — Yahoo/Tech (syndicated) explains that 8.8.8 forced GitHub as download source and 8.8.9 added signature and cert validation; MITM could previously swap the executable. citeturn0search1

## Key takeaways from articles
- Root cause: updater (WinGUp) accepted download URLs from server XML without enforcing domain/pinning and lacked signature verification; MITM could swap payload. citeturn0search0turn0search6
- Mitigations:
  - v8.8.8 (Nov 2025) hard‑pinned update downloads to GitHub (domain hardening). citeturn0search1
  - v8.8.9 (2025-12-09) adds signature + certificate verification on downloaded installers; aborts on failure. citeturn0search0turn0search1turn0search6
- Indicators mentioned: malicious gup.exe network requests to domains other than notepad-plus-plus.org / GitHub; unusual child processes spawned by gup.exe. citeturn0search0
- Maintainer guidance: remove legacy self-signed Notepad++ root certs; current releases signed with GlobalSign. citeturn0search0

## Links into repo history that match the coverage
- 2025-10-30 `e6739c0ab`: Notepad++ passes `INFO_URL` directly (HTTPS) to updater.
- 2025-11-16 `3daa59326`: forces download domain prefix (GitHub) to prevent hijacked URLs.
- 2025-12-01 `bcf2aa68e`: verifies certificate & signature on downloaded installer.
- 2025-12-09 `b5ce090bf`: Notepad++ 8.8.9 release (fix publicized in news).

## Open questions / next steps
- Confirm whether any stray self-signed certificates remain bundled in installers prior to 8.8.9.
- Collect hashes/IOCs from incident writeups (if published) and add to security-timeline once available.
- Check for upstream advisories or CVE assignment for the updater MITM flaw; currently reported as “weak validation” without CVE in press.
